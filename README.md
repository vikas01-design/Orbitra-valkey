# Valkey E-Commerce Demo

An e-commerce platform starter built with React, designed to showcase [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) capabilities across multiple subsystems. Created for the **Build Beyond Limits** hackathon powered by Valkey, hosted by React Hyderabad.

## Overview

This project provides a fully-featured e-commerce frontend that teams can extend with Valkey-powered backend services including authentication, search, caching, real-time recommendations, and more.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18 (Create React App)
- React Router v6
- Bootstrap 5 + SCSS
- Phosphor Icons, React Slick, AOS animations

**Backend (to be implemented by teams):**
- [Valkey Bundle](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-bundle) (all modules included)

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for running Valkey)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opensource-for-valkey/valkey-ecommerce-demo.git
cd valkey-ecommerce-demo
```

### 2. Start Valkey

Pull and run the Valkey bundle image which includes all modules:

```bash
docker pull valkey/valkey-bundle:9-alpine
docker run -d --name valkey -p 6379:6379 valkey/valkey-bundle:9-alpine
```

### 3. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Run the frontend

```bash
npm start
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Running Tests

The frontend uses Jest and React Testing Library (included with Create React App).

```bash
cd frontend

# Run tests in watch mode (interactive)
npm test

# Run tests once (CI mode)
CI=true npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
CI=true npm test -- --coverage
```

## Building for Production

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `frontend/build` folder.
